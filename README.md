## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm just retraining some basic things to get more familiar with all the HTML tags and some css properties.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card">
        <img class="images" src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR">
        <article class="article">
        <h3 class="title">Improve your front-end <br> skills by building proyects</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend <br> Mentor and take your coding skills to <br> the next level</p>
        </article>
    </div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  text-align: center;
    box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 15px 20px -5px,
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08) 0px 5px 5px -5px;
}
```


### Continued development

I will continue to practice in css to be more detail focused.
